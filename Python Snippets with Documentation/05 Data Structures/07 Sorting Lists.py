# List of complex objects, like a list of tuples, example a list of orders with product name and price
# in situations like this we need to define a function  to sort the list, the above methods don't work

    ("Product2", 50),
    ("Product3", 5)

# In this example we are going to sort the items base in price


def sort_items_price(index):
    return index[1]
# if each item in the list is a tuple we are returning the second item in the tuple


items.sort(key=sort_items_price)
