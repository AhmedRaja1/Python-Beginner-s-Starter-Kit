# # 19 Dictionaries

# Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict).
# Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”.
# Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.
# Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples;# if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.
# You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().
# It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).
# A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.
# Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
# The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key.
# It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten.
# It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.
# Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead).
# To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.
