16 Getting a Single Object

We need to edit ou view function "detail()" in the movies "app" to get an movie object.

we are goint to use the "Movie.objects.get()" method to get an movie from the data base.

def detail(request, movie_id):
    movie = Movie.objects.get(pk=movie_id)
    return render(request, "movies\detail.html", {"movie": movie})

Then we need to create a new template in the "template\movies" folder.
So add a new file "detail.html" to that folder.
